Opening paragraph — hook the reader. No heading needed here, just drop straight into prose.

## First Section

Use `##` for top-level sections within the post. Keep them short and scannable.

Inline images go anywhere:

![Alt text](/images/blog/my-post/detail.jpg)

Inline code looks like `this`, and code blocks look like:

```python
def example():
    return "hello"
```

## Another Section

- Bullet lists work like this
- Each item on its own line

1. Numbered lists too
2. For step-by-step content

> Blockquotes for callouts, quotes, or emphasis.

## Wrapping Up

Closing thoughts, what to read next, or a call to action.
